This is a set of configuration files for a bunch of Unix apps I use regularly.

The way I usually use this is as follows. Change the lines as appropriate for
your system.

Install Mercurial:
	$ sudo apt-get install mercurial

Change into your home directory and make a clone of the repository:
	$ cd
	$ hg clone http://delx.cjb.net/hg/hgdotfiles-generic .hgdotfiles-computername

Make a backup of any existing files:
	$ mkdir backup
	$ mv .bash* .ssh .vim* .Xresources .xscreensaver .screenrc .pythonrc.py .inputrc .ssh backup

Symlink the config files into your home directory:
	$ for f in $(ls -A .hgdotfiles-computername); do ln -s .hgdotfiles-computername/$i .; done
	$ rm .hg .hgignore


Your done now. You probably want to move your ssh keys back into ~/.ssh (which
now links to ~/.hgdotfiles-computername/.ssh), as well as add a few machine
specific configs to the bash init scripts.

Create files in ~/.bash called environment_local, interactive_local, etc to
do this. Also, learn how to use Mercurial and use it to version control other
configure files of yours.

Here are some good Mercurial tutorials:
